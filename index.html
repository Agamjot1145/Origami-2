                Origami is actually a very easy hobby to pick up and it’s a lot of fun. All you need is paper and you can use pretty much any paper you can find. This guide will show you the main folds, the basic bases that are used as the foundation for a huge number of different models and then you’ll learn how to fold your first model, the traditional paper crane.
